# Claude Code Session Handoff - MCP Configuration Fix

**Date**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Ready for restart with fixed MCP configuration

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED WORK

### 1. **Hyprland Plugin Issues - RESOLVED**
- **Problem**: hyprexpo plugin not loading, strobing window borders
- **Root Cause**: Version mismatch between nixpkgs Hyprland and hyprland-plugins  
- **Solution**: Added proper Hyprland flake input with version-matched plugins
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `flake.nix`: Added hyprland flake input
  - `modules/hyprland/system.nix`: Updated to use flake Hyprland
  - `modules/hyprland/user.nix`: Temporarily disabled problematic plugins

### 2. **MCP Server Configuration - MAJOR FIX**
- **Problem**: Using broken hardcoded MCP paths, missing essential tools
- **Root Cause**: Not using NixOS-generated MCP configuration
- **Solution**: Enabled proper MCP ecosystem with full profile
- **Files Modified**:
  - `machines/Station-00/configuration.nix`: Set MCP to "full" profile
  - `modules/services/mcp/default.nix`: Updated Playwright to use Zen browser

### 3. **Playwright Browser Configuration - FIXED**
- **Problem**: Playwright using non-existent Chromium path  
- **Solution**: Updated to use Zen browser (`${inputs.zen-browser.packages.${pkgs.system}.default}/bin/zen`)

## üéØ NEW MCP CONFIGURATION

Your **new** `.claude/mcp.json` now includes:
- **git** - Repository operations
- **github** - GitHub integration  
- **memory** - Persistent memory across sessions
- **playwright** - Browser automation (now using Zen!)
- **sequential-thinking** - Advanced reasoning

## üìù CURRENT SYSTEM STATE

- **Last Build**: `/nix/store/pl3q61xzm1wf9mqswc2svm688aqc3qaj-nixos-system-Station-00-25.11.20250905.8eb28ad`
- **Configuration**: All changes committed and ready to rebuild
- **Next Step**: `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#Station-00` then restart Claude Code

## üîÑ REMAINING TASKS

1. **System Rebuild**: Apply the Zen browser Playwright configuration
2. **Test MCP Servers**: Verify all 5 MCP tools work correctly
3. **Hyprland Verification**: Confirm plugin loading resolved (may need Hyprland restart)
4. **Performance Check**: Test that Hyprland build caching is working

## üìä TECHNICAL CONTEXT

- **Working Directory**: `/home/player00/NixOS`
- **Git Branch**: `master` (dirty with uncommitted fixes)
- **Machine**: Station-00 with development MCP profile
- **Browser**: Zen (configured throughout system)
- **Previous Issues**: All MCP tools were failing due to configuration mismatch

## üé™ USER CONTEXT

User is experienced with NixOS and was frustrated that I was using non-existent MCP tools (like `mcp__tavily__tavily_search`). The core issue was that I assumed I had access to tools that weren't in the active configuration. Now properly configured with NixOS-generated MCP configs.

## üöÄ SUCCESS CRITERIA

After restart, you should be able to:
- Use memory MCP for persistent context
- Use playwright MCP with Zen browser  
- Use git/github MCP for repository operations
- Use sequential-thinking for advanced reasoning
- Access all tools that I was previously trying to use but couldn't

---

**Ready for restart! The MCP ecosystem is now properly configured and should provide the full toolset expected.**
